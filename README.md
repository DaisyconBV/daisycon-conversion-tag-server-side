# Daisycon Conversion Tag Server-side (Hybrid)

This is Daisycon’s official server-side tag template for conversion tracking in Google Tag Manager (GTM). It’s used in your server-side GTM container and works together with the client-side Synergy Tag to support hybrid tracking.

Together, these tags improve the accuracy of your affiliate reporting, even when browser limitations might otherwise block key data.

## What it does

This tag sends conversion details directly from your server to Daisycon. When paired with the Synergy Tag on the client side, it enables hybrid tracking, which delivers more the best of both worlds for more consistent results than server-side tracking alone.

Here’s what it does for you:

* **Tracks conversions reliably**: Sends campaign and transaction data to Daisycon from your server.
* **Supports hybrid tracking**: Works with the Synergy Tag to connect server-side sales to browser-side clicks.
* **Improves performance**: Hybrid setups help recover data that might be lost with server-side tracking alone, leading to more accurate reports and optimal results.

In short: this tag is essential for Daisycon affiliate tracking when you're using server-side GTM.
